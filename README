1. DESCRIPTION

Random Nintendo DS development tools. Use these for your Nintendo DS
homebrew projects!


2. CONTACT

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at
ville.helin#iki.fi. I might not remember much as it's 2021 today,
and this stuff is from over 10 years ago from my backup... :)


3. VERSION HISTORY

v1.0 (23-Jan-2021)
  * First public release. I wrote these tools back in 2006+, used
    mainly in my homebrew tests, and that was it. Now, in 2021, I
    feel like I should release them as open source as they are
    just gathering dust on my backup drive...


4. NOTE

ttuPlayer is perhaps the most valuable piece of code here. It's a .mod
player, but first you need to use modToTTU to turn .mod files into
.ttu (patterns) and .tts (samples) files.

The player itself (ttuStart() and ttuTick()) needs to run on the ARM7
side of Nintendo DS. See the code in arm7 folder for more information.
